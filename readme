Jennifer Secrest, AnneMarie Caballero, Assignment 5

Jennifer Secrest's Contribution:

---

As usual, AnneMarie and I coded a lot of the assignment over
live share. Because of scheduling issues, we did do some parts
separately but were sure to balance the work and review
everything that we did (and the majority was definitely done
together). One part that I focused on was adding the delay and
concurrent processes.

AnneMarie Caballero's Contribution:

As with our other assignments, Jen and I pair coded most of the
assignment together. We did end up doing some of the testing
separately because Jen had a competitive swim meet, but
we created a list to test together then divided up the work.
We also resolved pylint errors together. During our pair
coding, we would switch on who worked on what. One area
I contributed to more was the client-side thread work.

Help received from other people:

We received help from Bob Dondero in office hours for resolving
issues with our last assignment, particularly our use
of the itemActivated event listener. We also talked
to Anat Kleiman about when our window was showing, which
was originally later than we wanted, but was resolved
by completing a later step in the assignment.

Sources of information:

Stated above. We also used the course materials and the following
resources (their purpose was cited where used):
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pyqt5-how-to-align-text-of-label/
https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide6/QtCore/Qt.html
https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide6/QtWidgets/

Additionally, we used the following two resources to
understand how to get and select items from a list:
https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-5/PySide2/QtWidgets/QListWidget.html
https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-5/PySide2/QtWidgets/QListWidgetItem.html

Additionally, the safequeue class was taken directly from course
materials as it was indicated we were allowed to do on Ed.

Time spent on the assignment: 5-7 hours

Assessment of assignment:

Jennifer Secrest: I liked that we directly edited assignment
2 to make it more efficient with the correct state pages, as
we were able to see the direct effect and added efficiency
of first adding the processes, then the threads (as well
as completing all of the other steps for this assignment).
I think that it helped with my understanding of processes,
threads, and their usefulness.

AnneMarie Caballero: This really helped my understanding of
processes and threads. I honestly really struggled with
distinguishing them in class, and now I feel much more familiar
with the concepts of both. Also, I think it built upon the
earlier assignment nicely to fix some of the design
flaws in the assignment.

No known bugs.

Jennifer Secrest, AnneMarie Caballero, Assignment 2

_______________________________________________________________________

Similar to Assignment 1, we worked on all parts of this assignment
together. Some work that I specifically contributed was the intial
creation/setup of the widgets, using class examples as a reference. I
also worked on the separation of our query statements into classes and
methods and ensuring the correct text formatting (especially for
details). We used live share, so we wrote a lot together, either coding
in different places at once or debugging our partner's code as they went
along. We created and tested all of the necessary errors together.

AnneMarie Caballero's Contribution:

We pair coded the entire assignment, which means that we both contributed to all
parts of the assignment. As Jen mentioned, we used Live Share to do this. One part
I assisted on in particular was modularizing the code and focusing on our style.
Additionally, I was the one who explicitly coded argparse, although Jen was there
helping.

We also resolved all pylint warnings together, debugged together, and
wrote test modules for our code together. In sum, Jen and I
pair coded everything together, so we were both equally responsible
for each part of the assignment.

Help received from other people:

We got help at office hours from Anat Kleiman and Joshua
Gardner. They helped with our understanding of corrupted databases, injection attacks,
and helped debug an issue with formatting. Any online resources are cited throughout the code.
In addition to anything cited, we used documents provided on the course page and the print-outs
given in class.

Sources of information:

Stated above. Given through the course or cited throughout the code.

Time spent on the assignment: 13-15 hours

Assessment of assignment:

Jennifer Secrest: I thought that the assignment helped me learn a lot. It was a great introduction
to database programming, as I felt I got a lot of exposure to this but felt comfortable using
the syntax from the start after we learned it in lecture. I think the part of the assignment
that took the longest was getting everything to match between the files (errors, status returns,
formatting), so most time was spent on those details. Overall, great assignment to expose to python
and SQL and I learned a lot!

AnneMarie Caballero: I thought this assignment was really helpful. It was a great introduction to
SQL, and I feel I understand the SELECT command much better now. The part of the assignment that took the
longest was probably getting started, since this is the first assignment. Overall, I thought it went
well and was a very informative introduction to both Python and database programming.

No known bugs.
